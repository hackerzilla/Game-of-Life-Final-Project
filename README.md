# Game-of-Life-Final-Project
I'm making a John Conway's game of life simulation using C++ and SDL for a final project.

To be able to compile and run this application, you have to link it against the SDL.dll dynamic library or by compiling SDL.h and linking it with your program.
Here is the tutorial I used to get SDL up and running for Visual Studio on Windows only :( : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxCC9Ces1Yg
